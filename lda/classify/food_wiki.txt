'''Food''' is any substance<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/food|title=food|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en}}</ref> consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. It is usually of [[plant]] or [[animal]] origin, and contains essential [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|proteins]], [[vitamin]]s, or [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral]]s. The substance is [[Ingestion|ingested]] by an [[organism]] and assimilated by the organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to provide [[energy]], maintain life, or stimulate growth.

Historically, [[human]]s secured food through two methods: [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and [[agriculture]]. Today, the majority of the [[food energy]] required by the ever [[Population growth|increasing]] [[world population|population of the world]] is supplied by the [[food industry]].

[[Food safety]] and [[food security]] are monitored by agencies like the [[International Association for Food Protection]], [[World Resources Institute]], [[World Food Programme]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and [[International Food Information Council]]. They address issues such as [[sustainability]], [[biological diversity]], [[climate change]], [[nutritional economics]], [[population growth]], [[water supply]], and [[Food security|access to food]].

The [[right to food]] is a [[human right]] derived from the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]), recognizing the "[[right to an adequate standard of living]], including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from [[hunger]]".

==Food sources==
Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. [[Cereal]] grain is a [[staple food]] that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food/|title=food|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-03-01|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en}}</ref> [[Maize|Corn (maize)]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]] – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.<ref name="prodstat">{{cite web |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx |title=ProdSTAT |work=FAOSTAT |accessdate=2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Favour|first=Eboh|title=DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A MILL PULVERIZER|url=http://www.academia.edu/27186173/DESIGN_AND_FABRICATION_OF_A_MILL_PULVERIZER|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=039ZCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA846#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Complete Book on Spices & Condiments (with Cultivation, Processing & Uses) 2nd Revised Edition: With Cultivation, Processing & Uses|last=Engineers|first=NIIR Board of Consultants &|date=2006-04-01|publisher=ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS PRESS Inc.|isbn=9788178330389|language=en}}</ref> Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.

Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible [[fungi]], especially [[mushroom]]s. Fungi and ambient [[bacteria]] are used in the preparation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and [[pickled]] foods like [[Baker's yeast|leavened]] [[bread]], [[alcoholic drinks]], [[cheese]], [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[kombucha]], and [[yogurt]]. Another example is [[blue-green algae]] such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]].<ref>McGee, 333–334.</ref> Inorganic substances such as [[salt]], [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] and [[potassium hydrogen tartrate|cream of tartar]] are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.

===Plants===

{{see also|Herb|spice}}

Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. Many of these plant species have several distinct [[cultivar]]s.<ref>McGee, 253.</ref>

[[Seed]]s of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as [[Omega-3|omega fats]]. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals ([[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[et cetera]]), [[legume]]s ([[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, et cetera), and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Oilseed]]s are often pressed to produce rich oils - [[sunflower]], [[flaxseed]], [[rapeseed]] (including [[canola oil]]), [[sesame]], [[et cetera]].<ref name=McGee9>McGee, Chapter 9.</ref>

Seeds are typically high in [[unsaturated fat]]s and, in moderation, are considered a [[health food]], although not all seeds are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a [[lemon]], pose a choking hazard, while seeds from [[cherries]] and [[apple]]s  contain [[cyanide]] which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2737/|title=Are apple cores poisonous?|publisher=The Naked Scientists, University of Cambridge|date=26 Sep 2010|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>

[[Fruit]]s are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have [[coevolution|coevolved]] such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may [[Excretion|excrete]] the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[eggplant]]s, are eaten as vegetables.<ref>McGee, Chapter 7.</ref> (For more information, see [[list of fruits]].)

[[Vegetable]]s are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include [[root vegetable]]s ([[potato]]es and [[carrot]]s), bulbs ([[onion]] family), [[leaf vegetable]]s ([[spinach]] and [[lettuce]]), [[:Category:Stem vegetables|stem vegetables]] ([[bamboo]] shoots and [[asparagus]]), and [[:Category:Inflorescence vegetables|inflorescence vegetables]] ([[globe artichoke]]s and [[broccoli]] and other vegetables such as [[cabbage]] or [[cauliflower]]).<ref>McGee, Chapter 6.</ref>

===Animals===
{{Main article|Animal source foods|Food chain}}
[[File:Meatfoodgroup.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Various raw [[meat]]s]]
Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. [[Meat]] is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from [[muscle]] systems or from [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Food products produced by animals include [[milk]] produced by [[mammary glands]], which in many cultures is drunk or processed into [[dairy product]]s (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds and other animals lay [[Egg (food)|eggs]], which are often eaten, and [[bee]]s produce [[honey]], a reduced [[nectar]] from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures [[blood as food|consume blood]], sometimes in the form of [[blood sausage]], as a thickener for sauces, or in a [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]], [[Salting (food)|salted]] form for times of food scarcity, and others use [[blood]] in stews such as [[jugging|jugged hare]].<ref>Davidson, 81–82.</ref>

Some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. [[Vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. [[Vegan]]s do not consume any foods that are or contain [[ingredients]] from an animal source.

==Production==
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|right|A [[tractor]] pulling a [[chaser bin]]]]
{{Main article|Agriculture|Food industry|Genetically modified food}}
Most food has always been obtained through [[agriculture]]. With increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern [[industrial agriculture]], there has been a growing trend toward [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable agricultural]] practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages [[biodiversity]], local self-reliance and [[organic farming]] methods.<ref>Mason</ref> Major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), national government policy (or law), and war.<ref name="Messer">Messer, 53–91.</ref>

In popular culture, the mass production of food, specifically meats such as [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and [[beef]], has come under fire from various [[Documentary film|documentaries]], most recently [[Food, Inc]], documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals, often for easier revenues from [[corporate farming|large corporations]]. Along with a current trend towards [[environmentalism]], people in [[Western culture]] have had an increasing trend towards the use of [[Herbalism|herbal supplements]], foods for a specific group of people (such as dieters, women, or athletes), [[functional food]]s (fortified foods, such as omega-3 eggs), and a more ethnically diverse diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Ome-Pop/Popular-Culture-Food-and.html|title=Popular Culture, Food and|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>

Several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which [[agroecosystem]]s provide food but also support vital [[ecosystem]] services so that [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] and [[biodiversity]] are maintained rather than compromised. According to the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]], well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fiber and animal products, they also provide services such as [[flood mitigation]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[erosion control]] and habitats for plants, birds, fish and other animals.<ref>Boelee, E. (Ed) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/ Ecosystems for water and food security], 2011, [[IWMI]], [[UNEP]]</ref>

==Taste perception==
{{main article|Taste}}
Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: [[sweet]], [[sour]], [[saltiness|salty]], [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]]. As animals have [[Evolution|evolved]], the tastes that provide the most energy ([[sugar]] and [[fat]]s) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], are not enjoyable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28063.php|title=Evolution of taste receptor may have shaped human sensitivity to toxic compounds|work=Medical News Today|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> Water, while important for survival, has no taste.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/598799.cms |work=The Times Of India |title=Why does pure water have no taste or colour? |date= 2004-04-03}}</ref> Fats, on the other hand, especially [[saturated fat]]s, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.

===Sweet===

[[File:Saccharose2.svg|thumb|right|200px|Structure of sucrose]]
Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, [[sweetness]] is almost always caused by a type of simple [[sugar]] such as [[glucose]] or [[fructose]], or [[disaccharides]] such as [[sucrose]], a molecule combining glucose and fructose.<ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary">New Oxford American Dictionary</ref> Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as [[sucralose]] are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include [[raw sugar]], which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.

The [[stevia]] plant contains a compound known as [[steviol]] which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.<ref><!--note-->The [[sweetness]] multiplier "300 times" comes from [http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&type=6&root=3&parent=3&cat=30 subjective evaluations by a panel of test subjects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123124043/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&type=6&root=3&parent=3&cat=30 |date=January 23, 2009 }} tasting various dilutions compared to a standard dilution of [[sucrose]]. Sources referenced in this article say steviosides have up to 250 times the sweetness of sucrose, but others, including stevioside brands such as SweetLeaf, claim 300 times. 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon (1.6–2.5 ml) of stevioside powder is claimed to have equivalent sweetening power to 1 cup (237 ml) of sugar.</ref>

===Sour===

Sourness is caused by the taste of [[acid]]s, such as [[vinegar]] in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include [[citrus]], specifically [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and to a lesser degree [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone [[rancidity|rancid]] due to bacteria.<ref>States "having an acid taste like lemon or vinegar: she sampled the wine and found it was sour. (of food, esp. milk) spoiled because of fermentation." New Oxford American Dictionary</ref> Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.

===Salty===
[[File:Piles of Salt Salar de Uyuni Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006 a.jpg|thumb|Salt mounds in [[Bolivia]]]]

[[Saltiness]] is the taste of [[alkali metal]] [[ions]] such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including [[sea salt]], [[fleur de sel]], [[kosher salt]], mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate [[electrolyte]] balance, which is the [[kidney]]'s function. Salt may be iodized, meaning [[iodine]] has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes [[thyroid]] function. Some canned foods, notably [[soup]]s or packaged [[broth]]s, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Fe-Ge/Food-Preservatives.html|title=Food Preservatives|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>

===Bitter===

[[Bitter (taste)|Bitterness]] is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark [[chocolate]], [[caffeine]], lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.

===Umami===

[[Umami]], the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture but has a long tradition in Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of [[glutamate]]s, especially [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).<ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/> It is characterized as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oKHDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=umami+is+characterized+as+savory,+meaty,+and+rich+in+flavor#v=onepage&q=umami%20is%20characterized%20as%20savory,%20meaty,%20and%20rich%20in%20flavor&f=false|title=Healing Herbal Teas: Learn to Blend 101 Specially Formulated Teas for Stress Management, Common Ailments, Seasonal Health, and Immune Support|last=Farr|first=Sarah|date=2016|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=9781612125749|language=en}}</ref> [[Salmon]] and [[mushrooms]] are foods high in umami.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=njypDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT86&dq=%C2%A0+%22Salmon%22,+mushrooms+are+foods+high+in+umami.#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0%20%22Salmon%22,%20mushrooms%20are%20foods%20high%20in%20umami.&f=false|title=Wine: The Essential Guide to Tasting, History, Culture and More|last=Feely|first=Caro|date=2015-11-12|publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD|isbn=9781783726837|language=en}}</ref>

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Cuisine|Regional cuisine|Global cuisines}}
[[File:Bali cuisine.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Balinese cuisine]] in [[Indonesia]]]]
Many scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country, and that it can be used as a form of communication. According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food "is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shugart|first=Helene A.|year=2008|title=Sumptuous Texts: Consuming "Otherness" in the Food Film Genre|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.jproxy.nuim.ie/doi/pdf/10.1080/15295030701849928?needAccess=true|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume=25 |issue=1|pages=68|via=|doi=10.1080/15295030701849928}}</ref>

Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of [[cooking]] traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as [[gastronomy]]. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.

Some popular types of ethnic foods include [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[African cuisine|African]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]]. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food [[Habit (psychology)|habits]]. While [[evolution]]arily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are [[omnivore]]s, religion and social constructs such as [[morality]], [[activism]], or [[environmentalism]] will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of [[taste]], the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.

===Presentation===
[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|left|A [[France|French]] basil salmon [[terrine (food)|terrine]], with eye-appealing [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]]]]
{{Main article|Food presentation}}
Aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people "eat with their eyes". Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |title=You first eat with your eyes |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203250/http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal">Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal</ref>

===Contrast in texture===
[[Texture (food)|Texture]] plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding [[granola]] to [[yogurt]], adding [[crouton]]s to a [[salad]] or [[soup]], and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aJBIbvClWfcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Food+texture#v=onepage&q=&f=false | title = Food Texture: Measurement and Perception | isbn = 978-0-8342-1238-1 | author1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Andrew J | date = 1999-02-28}}</ref>

===Contrast in taste===
Another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as [[sweetness]] and [[saltiness]] tend to go well together, as in [[kettle corn]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].

===Food preparation===
{{Main article|Outline of food preparation}}
While many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, [[palatability]], [[Mouthfeel|texture]], or [[flavor]]. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, [[pressure cooking]], fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a [[kitchen]]. Some preparation is done to enhance the [[taste]] or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to [[Food preservation|preserve]] the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A [[meal]] is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.<ref>Mead, 11–19</ref>
[[File:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh.]]

====Animal preparation====
The preparation of animal-based food usually involves [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]], [[evisceration (organ removal)|evisceration]], hanging, portioning, and [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering]]. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in [[slaughterhouses]], which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the [[United States]] has established the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as [[kosher]], [[shechita]], and [[dhabīḥah]] halal. Strict interpretations of [[kashrut]] require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.<ref>McGee, 142–143.</ref>

On the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and [[seafood]] may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.<ref>McGee, 202–206</ref>

====Cooking====
[[File:Wok cooking and the heat source by The Pocket in Nanjing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cooking with a [[wok]] in [[China]]]]
{{Main article|Cooking}}

The term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as [[culinary art]], generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual cook.<ref>McGee Chapter 14.</ref> The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.<ref name="silhnc">Mead, 11–19.</ref>

Cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, [[Mouthfeel|texture]], appearance, and nutritional properties.<ref>McGee</ref> Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at ''[[Homo erectus]]'' campsites dating from 420,000 years ago.<ref>Campbell, 312.</ref> Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of [[pottery]].<ref>McGee, 784.</ref>

=====Cooking equipment=====
[[File:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|A [[stainless steel]] [[frying pan]]]]
[[File:TraditionalAsado.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[asado]] (barbecue)]]
{{Main article|Cookware and bakeware}}

There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.

[[Oven]]s are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to {{convert|500|°F|°C}}) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a [[tandoor]] oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.<ref>Davidson, 782–783</ref> Western kitchens use variable temperature [[convection oven]]s, conventional ovens, [[toaster oven]]s, or non-radiant heat ovens like the [[microwave oven]]. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, [[natural gas|gas]], electric, or oil-fired.<ref>McGee, 539,784.</ref>

Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a [[sauté pan]], sauce pot, [[frying pan]], or [[pressure cooker]]. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as [[steam]]ing, [[simmer]]ing, [[boil]]ing, and [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] for moist methods, while the dry methods include [[sauté]]ing, [[pan fry]]ing, and [[deep-fry]]ing.<ref>McGee, 771–791</ref>

In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A [[Grill (cooking)|grill]] operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.<ref>Davidson, 356.</ref> A [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] style of barbecue is called [[barbacoa]], which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In [[Argentina]], an [[asado]] (Spanish for "grilled") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.<ref>Asado Argentina</ref>

====Raw food preparation{{anchor|Raw Food Preparation}}====
[[File:2007feb-sushi-odaiba-manytypes.jpg|thumb|left|Many types of [[fish]] ready to be eaten, including [[salmon]] and [[tuna]]]]

Certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a [[Raw foodism|raw state]]. [[Salad]]s consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. [[Sashimi]] in [[Japanese cuisine]] consists of raw sliced [[fish]] or other meat, and [[sushi]] often incorporates raw fish or seafood. [[Steak tartare]] and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with [[baguette]]s, [[brioche]], or [[frites]].<ref>Davidson, 786–787.</ref> In Italy, [[carpaccio]] is a dish of very thinly sliced raw [[beef]], drizzled with a [[vinaigrette]] made with olive oil.<ref>Robuchon, 224.</ref> The health food movement known as [[raw foodism]] promotes a mostly [[vegan]] diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above {{convert|118|°F|°C|sigfig=3}}.<ref>Davidson, 656</ref> An example of a raw meat dish is [[ceviche]], a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is "cooked" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.

[[File:Tom's Restaurant, NYC.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tom's Restaurant (Manhattan)|Tom's Restaurant]], a restaurant in [[New York City]]]]
{{Main article|Restaurant}}
Restaurants employ trained [[chef]]s who prepare food, and trained waitstaff to serve the customers. The term [[restaurant]] is credited to the [[France|French]] from the 19th century, as it relates to the restorative nature of the [[bouillon (broth)|bouillons]] that were once served in them. However, the concept pre-dates the naming of these establishments, as evidence suggests commercial food preparation may have existed during the age of the city of [[Pompeii]], and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in [[China]] during the [[Song dynasty]]. The [[coffeehouse|coffee shops]] or [[café]]s of 17th century [[Europe]] may also be considered an early version of the restaurant.<ref>Davidson, 660–661.</ref> In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion for out-of-home [[dining]]. Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants ([[fast food]]), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and [[vending machine]]s, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.<ref>United States Department of Agriculture</ref>

===Food manufacturing===
[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|thumb|Packaged household food items]]
{{Main article|Food manufacture}}
Packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a [[butcher]] preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international [[food industry]]. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved [[salting (food)|salting]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], curdling, [[drying (food)|drying]], [[pickling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], and [[smoking (food)|smoking]].<ref>Aguilera, 1–3.</ref> Food manufacturing arose during the [[industrial revolution]] in the 19th century.<ref>Miguel, 3.</ref> This development took advantage of new [[Mass-marketing|mass markets]] and emerging technology, such as [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], preservation, [[packaging]] and [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]], and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.<ref name=Jango>Jango-Cohen</ref>

At the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food [[brand]]s. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies.<ref>Hannaford</ref> Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated [[Food processing|processing]] and packaging methods, and [[logistics]] and [[food distribution|distribution]] advances can enhance product quality, improve [[food safety]], and reduce costs.<ref name=Jango/>

===International food imports and exports===
{{see also|Population density}}
The [[World Bank]] reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the USA and Japan. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s need for food was especially well illustrated in [[World War II]].  Despite the implementation of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

Food is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.<ref>The Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]</ref> Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.<ref>Regmi</ref> Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.<ref>[[CIA World Factbook]]</ref>

In 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in a dramatic increase in [[trade liberalization]]. This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] enforcement of [[Agricultural policy|agricultural subsidy]], [[Tax, tariff and trade|tariffs]], import [[Quota Share|quotas]], and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved.<ref>World Trade Organization, The Uruguay Round</ref> Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the World Health Organization. Trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade.<ref>Van den Bossche</ref>

===Marketing and retailing===
[[File:Fredmeyer edit 1.jpg|thumb|260px|Packaged food aisles of supermarket in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States|United States of America]]]]
{{main article|Food marketing}}
[[Food marketing]] brings together the producer and the consumer. It is the chain of activities that brings food from "farm gate to plate".<ref>Wansink, ''[[Marketing Nutrition]]'', 501–3.</ref> The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one [[canning|can]] of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.<ref>Smith, 501–3.</ref> The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.

In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to [[grocer]]s for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.<ref name="silhnc"/><ref name=Jango/> With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.<ref name="silhnc"/><ref>Benson</ref>

In the 20th century, [[supermarket]]s were born. Supermarkets brought with them a [[self service]] approach to shopping using [[shopping cart]]s, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through [[economies of scale]] and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.<ref>Humphery</ref>

Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large [[Corporation|companies]] control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to [[advertising]], transportation, and intermediate corporations.<ref>Magdoff, Fred (Ed.) "[T]he farmer's share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990."</ref>

===Prices===
[[Image:GrainProducts.jpg|thumb|right|Some essential food products including [[bread]], [[rice]] and [[pasta]]]]

[[File:Annual real food price indices.svg|thumb|Food, meat, dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar price indices, deflated using the World Bank Manufactures Unit Value Index (MUV)<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual real food price indices|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/worldfood/Reports_and_docs/Food_price_indices_data.xls|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref>]]
It is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of [[pork]] jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.<ref name="cnn24march2008">"Food prices rising across the world", CNN. 24 March 2008</ref>

Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]],<ref name="Ind"/> and the [[Arab Spring]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Did Food Prices Spur the Arab Spring?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/world-july-dec11-food_09-07/|website=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref> 
Food prices worldwide [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|increased in 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57652C20090807|title=World food prices stabilize, no drop in sight: WFP|work=Reuters|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/185426/inflation-slows-in-feb-as-food-prices-stabilize|title=Inflation slows in Feb. as food prices stabilize|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> 
One cause of rising food prices is wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry.<ref>[https://www.ibisworld.com/media/2014/07/02/serving-diversity-major-trends-food-services-sector/ May 2008, Global Trends: – Food Production and Consumption: The China Effect], ''IBISWorld''</ref>

In 2013 [[Overseas Development Institute]] researchers showed that [[rice]] has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.<ref>[http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats, August 2013,  The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration?

===As investment===
Institutions such as [[hedge fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s and [[investment bank]]s like [[Barclays Capital]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]]<ref name="Ind">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | title=The real hunger games: How banks gamble on food prices – and the poor lose out | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years, with investment in food [[commodity|commodities]] rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations.<ref name="Ind"/> Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in [[wheat]] futures. According to [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following [[George W Bush]]'s [[Commodities Futures Modernization Act]] of 2000.<ref name="Ind"/> De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: "What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or [[maize]]; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand."<ref name="Ind"/> In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the [[G20]] to regulate the commodities market more.<ref name="Ind"/>

Some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as [[climate change]], competition with [[bio-fuels]] and overall rising demand.<ref name="Ind"/> However, some such as [[Jayati Ghosh]], professor of economics at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[New Delhi]], have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.<ref name="Ind"/>

==Famine and hunger==
Food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately [[starvation]]. This is often connected with [[famine]], which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. [[Rationing]] is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.<ref name="Messer"/>

Starvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.<ref>[[World Health Organization]]</ref> Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and is measured using [[famine scales]].<ref>Howe, 353–372</ref>

===Food aid===
{{main article|Food aid}}
[[Food aid]] can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required.<ref>World Food Programme</ref> Conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop.<ref>Shah</ref> Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as [[food politics]]. Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries.<ref>Kripke</ref> International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the [[World Food Programme]].<ref>United Nations World Food program</ref>

==Safety==
{{Main article|Food safety}}
[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Salmonella]] bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in undercooked [[chicken]] and [[chicken egg]]s.]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HACCP Seven Principles.png|thumb|250px|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ([[HACCP]]) Flowchart]] -->

[[Foodborne illness]], commonly called "food poisoning", is caused by [[bacteria]], [[toxin]]s, [[virus]]es, [[parasite]]s, and [[prion]]s. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.<ref name=MedlinePlus>[[National Institute of Health]], MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia</ref> The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

[[Food poisoning]] has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates.<ref>[[Hippocrates]], [[s:On acute diseases|On Acute Diseases]].</ref> The sale of [[Rancidity|rancid]], contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of [[hygiene]], refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other [[microbiological]] studies by scientists such as [[Louis Pasteur]], contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of [[Justus von Liebig]], which led to the development of modern [[food storage]] and [[food preservation]] methods.<ref>Magner, 243–498</ref> In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] ([[HACCP]]), which can identify and eliminate many risks.<ref>USDA</ref>

Recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|title=Check Your Steps|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>

Foods that spoil easily, such as [[meats]], [[dairy]], and [[seafood]], must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040519004032/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archivedate=2004-05-19|title=Fact sheets - Poultry Preparation - Focus on Chicken}}</ref>

===Allergies===
{{Main article|Food allergy}}
Some people have [[allergies]] or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's [[immune system]] mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.<ref name=allergy>[[National Institute of Health]]</ref> The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are [[gluten]], [[maize|corn]], [[shellfish]] (mollusks), [[peanut]]s, and [[soy]].<ref name=allergy/> Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as [[diarrhea]], [[rash]]es, bloating, [[vomiting]], and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the [[allergen]].<ref name=allergy/>

Rarely, food allergies can lead to a [[medical emergency]], such as [[anaphylactic shock]], [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although [[latex]] products can induce similar reactions.<ref name=allergy/> Initial treatment is with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an [[Epi-pen]] or [[Twinject]].<ref>[http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx About Epipen], Epipen.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106164129/http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx |date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.twinject.com/ About Twinject], Twinject.com</ref>

===Other health issues===
Human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of [[Diet and cancer|cancers]] in a human epidemiological analysis by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Richard Peto]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Doll | first1 = R. | last2 = Peto | first2 = R. | title = The causes of cancer: Quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 1191–1308 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7017215 | doi=10.1093/jnci/66.6.1192}}</ref>  These cancer may be caused by [[carcinogen]]s that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain [[mycotoxin]]s such as [[aflatoxins]] which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts.  Other carcinogens identified in food include [[heterocyclic amine]]s generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, [[polyaromatic hydrocarbon]]s in charred meat and smoked fish, and [[nitrosamine]]s generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in [[cured meat]] such as [[bacon]].<ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens"/>

[[Anticarcinogen]]s that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. [[Antioxidant]]s are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.<ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens">{{cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-309-05391-9 }}</ref>

===Cultural and religious diets===
Dietary habits are the habitual decisions a person or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat.<ref name=Wansink>Wansink, ''[[Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think]]''</ref> Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food [[taboo]]s. Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only [[Kosher|kosher foods]] are permitted by [[Judaism]], [[halal]] foods by [[Islam]], and in [[Hinduism]] [[beef]] is restricted.<ref>Simoons</ref> In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's [[cuisine]].

===Diet deficiencies===
{{Main article|Avitaminosis}}
Dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of [[adipose]] tissue, known as body fat.<ref>Nicklas</ref> Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, [[iodine deficiency]].<ref>Merson, 245</ref> It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to [[vitamin A]] deficiency.<ref>Merson, 231.</ref> [[Vitamin C]] deficiency results in [[scurvy]].<ref>Merson, 464.</ref> [[Calcium]], [[Vitamin D]], and [[phosphorus]] are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. [[Kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]] are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.<ref>Merson, 224.</ref>

===Moral, ethical, and health-conscious diets===
Many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, [[vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a [[Healthy diet|healthier diet]], avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and [[antioxidant]]s.<ref>Carpenter</ref> [[Obesity]], a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], cancer and many other diseases.<ref>Merson, 266–268.</ref> More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from [[genetically modified food]].<ref>Parekh, 187–206.</ref> Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming ([[Cereal|grains]]) on [[animal welfare]], human health, and the [[Ecology|environment]] are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food]].<ref>Schor</ref>

==Nutrition and dietary problems==
[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]] replaced [[MyPyramid]] as the [[USDA]] nutrition guide.]]
Between the extremes of optimal health and death from [[starvation]] or [[malnutrition]], there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as [[scurvy]], [[obesity]], or [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular diseases]] as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] and [[vitamins]]. Additionally, food contains water and [[dietary fiber]].

As previously discussed, the body is designed by [[natural selection]] to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]]. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with [[biotechnology|advanced technology]], enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes [[obesity]] in adults and children alike.

==Legal definition==
Some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word ''foodstuff''. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by [[human]]s. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, [[chewing gum]], water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include [[Pet food|animal feed]], live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, [[cosmetics]], [[tobacco]] and tobacco products, [[narcotic]] or [[psychotropic substance]]s, and residues and contaminants.<ref>[[United Kingdom]] [[Office of Public Sector Information]]</ref>
