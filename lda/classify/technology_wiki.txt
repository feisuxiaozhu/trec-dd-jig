'''Technology''' ("science of craft", from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέχνη}}, ''techne'', "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]''<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book|title=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition)|first=Henry George|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-19-910207-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Liddell}}</ref>) is the collection of [[Art techniques and materials|techniques]], [[skill]]s, [[wikt:method|methods]], and [[Business process|processes]] used in the production of [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as [[scientific investigation]]. Technology can be the [[knowledge]] of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in [[machines]] to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of [[military technology]] has brought [[weapon]]s of ever-increasing destructive power, from [[club (weapon)|clubs]] to [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as [[pollution]] and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[natural environment|environment]]. Innovations have always influenced the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and raised new questions of the [[ethics of technology]].  Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].

Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].

== Definition and usage ==
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this [[printing press]], helped [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s communicate their ideas easily, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as cultural force.]]
The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the [[useful arts]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences|last=Crabb|first=George|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|year=1823|isbn=|location=London|page=524|quote=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> or to allude to technical education, as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (chartered in 1861).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT|last=Mannix|first=Loretta H.|last2=Stratton|first2=Julius Adams|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=0262195240|location=Cambridge|pages=190–92|quote=|via=}}</ref>

The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of ''[[:de:Technik|Technik]]'' into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''technik'' and ''technologie'' that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study of the [[industrial arts]] but to the industrial arts themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology Before 1930|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47}}</ref>

In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Technology and State Government|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|doi=10.2307/2084365}}</ref> Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists.  Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as [[applied science]], rather than as the things that people make and use.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Shaping of Technology|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald A.|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|publisher=Open University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-335-19913-5|edition=2nd|location=Buckingham|pages=|chapter=Introductory Essay|quote=|via=}}</ref> More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s work on [[technologies of the self]] (''techniques de soi'').

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The ''[[Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary]]'' offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology|title=Technology {{!}} Definition of Technology by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Real World of Technology|last=Franklin|first=Ursula|publisher=House of Anansi|year=1999|isbn=9780887848919|edition=revised|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.<ref>See, for example, {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology|title=Technology|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC News|access-date=November 7, 2016|via=}}</ref> [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."<ref>{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]] | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=0-8047-3041-5 | pages=17, 82}} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=2-7071-5495-4 | page=23}}</ref>

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; {{anchor|Virtual technology}}virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20150818090057/http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|archive-date=18 August 2005|dead-url=yes|work=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> [[W.

Brian |date=2009 |title=The Nature of Technology |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |page=28 |isbn=978-1-4165-4405-0 }}</ref>

The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology," it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. "[[State-of-the-art]] technology" refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

==Science, engineering and technology==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/science|title=Science|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]], and [[safety]].{{Citation needed|reason=This implies that some technologies are not product of science if they have utility, that seems wrong|date=August 2017}}

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Intute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217141847/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |archive-date=17 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=17 February 2007 |df= }}</ref>

The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science – The Endless Frontier'': "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&nbsp;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm#summary|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=George|year=1985|title=Science and Technology|journal=Osiris (2nd Series)|volume=1|pages=229–46|doi=10.1086/368647|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Between Politics and Science: Assuring the Integrity and Productivity of Research|last=Guston|first=David H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-65318-5|location=New York|pages=|quote=|postscript=<!--None-->|via=}}</ref>

Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress.

[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools]]

Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance that allowed [[deforestation|forest clearance]] on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding [[Mesolithic]] in some areas such as [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=The early prehistory in the west of Ireland: Investigations into the social archaeology of the Mesolithic, west of the Shannon, Ireland.|date=2006|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_2.html}}</ref> [[Agriculture]] fed larger populations, and the transition to [[sedentism]] allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as [[nomad]]ic ones must.

[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented circa 4000 BCE.]]
{{Main article|History of transport}}
Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat that dates back to the 8th millennium BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The oldest representation of a Nile boat|journal=Antiquity|volume=81}}</ref> From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual [[flooding of the Nile]] to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins.

However, more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention.{{Clarify|date=August 2017}}

The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early [[mass production]] of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through [[water wheel]]s, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.

=== Medieval and modern history (300 CE&nbsp;– present) ===
{{Main article|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|Information Technology|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology took another step in a [[second industrial revolution]] with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]], and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]] and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to [[skyscraper]]s and broad [[urban area]]s whose inhabitants rely on [[motor]]s to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[airplane]] and [[automobile]].

[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.]]
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Information technology]] subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]], which ushered in the current [[Information Age]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments.

Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education&nbsp;– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]] and [[architecture]].

==Philosophy==
===Technicism===
Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=9780007437863|editor-last=Breslin|editor-first=Gerry|location=|pages=|chapter=technicism|quote=|via=}}</ref> Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific-technological methods and tools."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Philosophical and Ethical Problems of Technicism and Genetic Engineering|journal=Society for Philosophy and Technology|volume=3}}</ref> In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as [[Stephen V. Monsma]],<ref name="Monsma 1986">{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 0-8028-0175-7 }}</ref> connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher [[moral authority]].

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.

Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the [[human condition]] is just another barrier to be surpassed.

Singularitarians believe in some sort of "[[accelerating change]]"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a "[[Technological singularity|Singularity]]" after [[artificial general intelligence]] is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/#WhenWillTheSingularity|title=Intelligence Explosion FAQ|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|date=November 10, 2015|website=|publisher=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]]|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> but prominent futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045.

Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=9781101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=The Six Epochs|quote=|via=}}</ref>

Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm|title=Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|last=Hughes|first=James|date=|website=Changesurfer|publisher=|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref>

===Skepticism and critics===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-Luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|[[Luddites]] smashing a power loom in 1812]]
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the [[Luddites]] and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see "[[The Question Concerning Technology]]"<ref name="Heidegger 1977">{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=21 November 2007 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 0-613-91314-0}}</ref>). According to Heidegger scholars [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa, "Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=25–26|translator-last=Lovitt|translator-first=W.|chapter=The Question Concerning Technology|quote=|via=}}</ref> What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Romanticism|last=Dreyfus|first=Hubert|last2=Spinosa|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Kompridis|editor-first=Nikolas|location=New York|pages=265–81|chapter=Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday|quote=|via=}}</ref>

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[William Gibson]] and films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.

The late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called "technopolies," societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values and world-views.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|last=Postman|first=Neil|publisher=Vintage|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

[[Darin Barney]] has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.<ref>{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Google|last=Barney|first=Darin|publisher=House of Anansi Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Bill Joy|William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Technology's Challenge to Democracy|journal=Parrhesia|volume=8}}</ref>

Another prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books such as ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.

A more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by the Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]] and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure.

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]] was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as [[E. F. Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[ecovillage]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.

===Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century===
''This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. ''

{{Quotation|The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. [...] What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?|Bernstein, Jared|"It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It’s the Weak
Economy, Among Other Things," in [[The American Prospect]]|October 2014}}

In his article, [[Jared Bernstein]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|title=Jared Bernstein|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]]|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> questions the widespread idea that [[automation]], and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing [[labor market]] problem.
His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning [[unemployment]] and declining wages.

He uses two main arguments to defend his point.
First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, [[automation]] <nowiki/>threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that "requires flexibility judgment and common sense"<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title=It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It's the Weak Economy, Among Other Things|journal=The American Prospect|volume=25}}</ref> remain hard to replace with [[machine]]s. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.

Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about "bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income and opportunity."<ref name=":0" />

===Complex technological systems===
[[Thomas P. Hughes]] stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=9780226359335|location=Chicago|pages=1–11|quote=|via=}}</ref> What is the difference between a [[wheel]] or a [[compass]] and cooking machines such as an [[oven]] or a [[gas stove]]? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?

Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity".<ref name="Hughes, Thomas P. 2004">Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) “Introduction: Complex Technology” (1–11) in "Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture"</ref> This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies," but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.

Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and [[Management|managers]] have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.<ref name=":1" /> For instance, [[Evgeny Morozov]] particularly challenges two concepts: “Internet-centrism” and “solutionism."<ref>{{Cite book|title=To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2013|isbn=9781610391399|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to [[Alexis Madrigal]]'s review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=March 13, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=}}</ref> Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Benjamin |last1=Cohen |first2=Gwen |last2=Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen| chapter=Introduction: Environmental Justice and the Transformation of Science and Engineering |date=2011 |pages=1–18 |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=9780262015790}}</ref>

Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed&nbsp;– especially in cases dealing with [[environmental justice]] and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science "[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions."<ref>{{cite book |first1=Gwen |last1= Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |date=2011 |pages=229–48 |chapter=Rupturing Engineering Education: Opportunities for Transforming Expert Identities Through Community-Based Projects |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=9780262015790}}</ref>

==Competitiveness==
Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.

Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[DuPont]], [[General Motors|GM]]) and it is what was used to transform the US into a [[superpower]]. It was not economic-based planning.

==Future technology==
{{main article|Emerging technologies}}

[[Theories of technology]] often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the [[high technology]] and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology's is uncertain.

In 2005, futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]], with robotics being the most important of the three.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=9781101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=GNR: Three Overlapping Revolutions|quote=|via=}}</ref>
