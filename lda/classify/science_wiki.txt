From [[classical antiquity]] through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to [[philosophy]] than it is now, and in the [[Western world]] the term "[[natural philosophy]]" once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as [[astronomy]], medicine, and [[physics]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}{{efn|Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"}} Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the [[scientific method]] itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was during this time that scientific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] reached their modern shapes.

Science in a broad sense existed before the [[modern era]] and in many historical [[civilization]]s.{{efn|"The historian&nbsp;... requires a very broad definition of "science"&nbsp;— one that&nbsp;... will help us to understand the modern scientific enterprise. We need to be broad and inclusive, rather than narrow and exclusive&nbsp;... and we should expect that the farther back we go [in time] the broader we will need to be."&nbsp;— [[David Pingree]] (1992), "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science" ''Isis'' '''83''' 554–63, as cited in {{harv|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}, ''The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context'', Second ed.

Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, [[public works]] at national scale, such which those which harnessed the [[floodplain]] of the [[Yangtse]] with reservoirs,<ref>[[Sima Qian]] (d. 86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (太史公书) covering some 2500 years of Chinese history, records [[Sunshu Ao]] (孙叔敖, fl. 630 BCE- ca. 595 BCE —[[Zhou dynasty]]), the first known [[hydraulic engineer]] of China, cited in ([[Joseph Needham]] et.al (1971) ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''4.3''' p.271) as having built a reservoir which has lasted to this day.</ref> dams, and dikes, and buildings such as [[Giza pyramid complex|the Pyramids]].  However, no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.

A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by [[Socrates]] to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, however, so Socrates was executed as a heretic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Apol.+30&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170|title=Plato, Apology, section 30|last=|first=|date=1966|website=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=Tufts University|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>{{rp| 30e}} [[Aristotle]] later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy which was [[teleological]] and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]] and [[final cause]] and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the [[actualization]] of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]]), they did not argue for any other types of [[applied science]].

Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the "theoretical" steps of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.{{efn|"...&nbsp;[A] man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty—for unless he is more certain of his first principles than of the conclusion drawn from them he will only possess the knowledge in question accidentally."&nbsp;— {{cite book|author1=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|edition=H.

During [[late antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "[[natural philosophy]]" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like [[Isidore of Seville]].

In the later medieval period, as demand for translations grew (for example, from the [[Toledo School of Translators]]), western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. In particular, the texts of Aristotle, [[Ptolemy]],{{efn|The translator, [[Gerard of Cremona]] (c. 1114–87), inspired by his love of the [[Almagest]], came to Toledo, where he knew he could find the Almagest in Arabic. There he found Arabic books of every description, and learned Arabic in order to translate these books into Latin, being aware of 'the poverty of the Latins'.&nbsp;—As cited by Charles Burnett (2001) "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century", pp. 250, 255, 257, ''Science in Context'' '''14'''(1/2), 249–88 (2001). {{doi|10.1017/0269889701000096}}}} and [[Euclid]], preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. The influx of ancient texts caused the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]] and the flourishing of a synthesis of [[Catholicism]] and [[Aristotelianism]] known as [[Scholasticism]] in [[western Europe]], which became a new geographic center of science. Scholasticism's strong focus on revelation and [[dialectic|dialectic reasoning]] was questioned by [[Roger Bacon]] (13th century), who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by Alhazen's [[Book of Optics]]. Scholasticism gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries.

Medieval science carried on the views of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenist civilization]] of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work ''A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book'' from [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]]'s catalog, as cited in {{harv|Smith|2001}}.{{rp|'''91'''(vol.1), p. xv}} Alhazen conclusively disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but he retained Aristotle's ontology; [[Roger Bacon]], [[Vitello]], and [[John Peckham]] each built up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'', a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657358?seq=71#page_scan_tab_contents p. lxxii, via JSTOR]</ref>  This model of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.

Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&nbsp;— this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.}}

[[Copernicus]] formulated a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system unlike the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.

[[Galileo]] made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems," which greatly offended him.<ref name="Pope Urban VIII">{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|title=Pope Urban VIII|last=van Helden|first=Al|date=1995|website=The Galileo Project|publisher=|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the [[printing press]] was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. [[René Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation.
Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "[[formal cause]]," of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]]. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[classical mechanics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from [[Aristotelian physics]], but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "[[energy]]" and "[[potential]]" (modern versions of Aristotelian "[[actuality and potentiality|''energeia'' and ''potentia'']]"). In the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a ''type of pursuit'' of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature&nbsp;— coming close in meaning to the old term "[[natural philosophy]]."

The laws of [[thermodynamics]] and the [[electromagnetic theory]] were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].

In the first half of the century, the development of [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "[[atomic energy]]" ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to [[antibiotic]]s and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation ([[automobiles]] and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]], all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science.

Widespread use of [[integrated circuits]] in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s. 

Harmful [[environmental issue]]s such as [[ozone depletion]], [[acidification]], [[eutrophication]] and [[climate change]] came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].

== Scientific method ==

{{Main article|Scientific method}}
The [[scientific method]] seeks to [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] explain the events of [[nature]] in a [[reproducible]] way.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|p=13}}: "The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!" ''(Author's punctuation)''}} An explanatory [[thought experiment]] or [[hypothesis]] is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "[[Occam's Razor]]") and are generally expected to seek [[consilience]]—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.<ref name=EOWilson>{{cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edward | title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-679-76867-X| ref = harv }}</ref> This new explanation is used to make [[falsifiable]] predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|pp=4–5}}: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&nbsp;— each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Fara|2009|p=204}}: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that&nbsp;... distinguished them from non-scientists."}} This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish [[causality|causal relationships]] (to avoid the [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation fallacy]]).

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|p=208}} If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a [[scientific theory]], a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a [[Scientific modelling|model]], an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|pp=199–201}}

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.<ref>{{cite web | last=van Gelder | first=Tim | year=1999 | url=http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf | format=PDF | title="Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy | publisher=University of Melbourne | accessdate=March 28, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Pease | first=Craig | date=September 6, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619154617/http://law-and-science.net/Science4BLJ/Scientific_Method/Deliberate.bias/Text.htm | archivedate = June 19, 2010 | title=Chapter 23.

=== Mathematics and formal sciences ===
{{Main article|Mathematics}}
[[Image:Venn A intersect B.svg|thumb|right|A [[Venn diagram]] illustrating the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]].]]

[[Mathematics]] is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting [[measurements]], as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. For example, [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and [[calculus]] are all essential to [[physics]]. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including "pure" areas such as [[number theory]] and [[topology]].

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]], which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.

[[Computational science]] applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|title=SIAM: Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

A great amount of interest was taken in the study of [[formal logic]] in the early 20th century among mathematicians and [[philosophers]] with the rise of [[set theory]] and its use for the foundations of mathematics. Notable mathematicians and philosophers who contributed to this field include: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Giuseppe Peano]], [[George Boole]], [[Ernst Zermelo]], [[Abraham Fraenkel]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred Whitehead]] among many others. Various axiomatic systems such as [[Peano arithmetic]], the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel]] system of set theory, as well as the system in [[Principia Mathematica]], were thought by many to prove the foundations of math. However, in 1931, with the publication of [[Kurt Gödel|Kurt Gödel's]] [[incompleteness theorem]], much of their effort was undermined.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/incompleteness-theorem|title= Incompleteness theorem|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> Formal logic is still studied today at universities by students of mathematics, philosophy, and [[computer science]]. For example, [[Boolean algebra]] is employed by all modern computers to function, and thus is an extremely useful branch of knowledge for [[Computer programming|programmers]].

Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical [[theorem]]s and [[formula]]s are obtained by [[Mathematical logic|logical]] derivations which presume [[axiom]]atic systems, rather than the combination of [[Empirical evidence|empirical observation]] and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the [[scientific method]]. In general, mathematics is classified as [[formal science]], while natural and social sciences are classified as [[empirical]] sciences.<ref>{{cite book| title = Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory | author = Bunge, Mario Augusto | year = 1998 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 0-7658-0413-1 | page = 24}}</ref>

== Scientific community ==
{{Main article|Scientific community}}

The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant.

=== Branches and fields ===
{{Main article|Branches of science}}
<!-- The organizational tables have been moved to the main article "Fields of science" -->
[[File:Cerebrum lobes.svg|thumb|left|The [[somatosensory system]] is located throughout our bodies but is integrated in the [[brain]].]]
Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: [[natural science]]s, which study natural phenomena (including [[Biology|biological life]]), and [[social science]]s, which study [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]]. These are both [[empirical]] sciences, which means their knowledge must be based on observable [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary [[applied sciences]], such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own [[nomenclature]] and expertise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/scientific_method_relationships_among_scientific_paradigms/|title=Scientific Method: Relationships Among Scientific Paradigms|last=|first=|date=March 7, 2007|website=|publisher=Seed Magazine|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

[[Mathematics]], which is classified as a [[formal science]],<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB |author= Tomalin, Marcus |year=2006| title=Linguistics and the Formal Sciences |doi=10.2277/0521854814 |publisher=Cambridge.org |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity|journal=Synthese|volume=133}}</ref> has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11}} The formal sciences, which also include [[statistics]] and [[logic]], are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Theory|theories]], and [[physical law|laws]],{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82}} both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).

Apart from its broad meaning, the word "science" sometimes may specifically refer to [[fundamental science]]s (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering, each of which is an [[applied science]].

=== Institutions ===
[[Learned society|Learned societies]] for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the [[Renaissance]] period.<ref>{{cite web| last=Parrott | first=Jim | date=August 9, 2007 | url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/1599andearlier.html | title=Chronicle for Societies Founded from 1323 to 1599 | publisher=Scholarly Societies Project | accessdate=September 11, 2007}}</ref> The oldest surviving institution is the Italian {{lang|it|''[[Accademia dei Lincei]]''}} which was established in 1603.<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=September 11, 2007}}</ref> The respective National [[Academy of Sciences|Academies of Science]] are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British [[Royal Society]] in 1660<ref>{{cite web| url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ | title= History of the Royal Society | publisher=The Royal Society | accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref> and the French {{lang|fr|''[[Académie des Sciences]]''}} in 1666.<ref>{{cite web | first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118174108/http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | archivedate=January 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

International scientific organizations, such as the [[International Council for Science]], have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the [[National Science Foundation]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[CONICET|National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] in Argentina, [[CSIRO]] in Australia, {{lang|fr|[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]}} in France, the [[Max Planck Society]] and {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}} in Germany, and [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] in Spain.

=== Literature ===
{{Main article|Scientific literature}}

An enormous range of [[scientific literature]] is published.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=John Ziman| last=Ziman | first=J.M. | journal=Science | title=The proliferation of scientific literature: a natural process | year=1980 | volume=208 | issue=4442 | pages=369–71 | doi= 10.1126/science.7367863 | pmid=7367863 | ref=harv | bibcode=1980Sci...208..369Z }}</ref> [[Scientific journal]]s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'' followed by the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.<ref>{{cite book | first=Krishna | last=Subramanyam |author2=Subramanyam, Bhadriraju | year=1981 | title=Scientific and Technical Information Resources | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=0-8247-8297-6 | oclc=232950234 }}</ref> The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 }}</ref>

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

[[List of science magazines|Science magazines]] such as ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Science & Vie]]'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. [[Science book]]s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the [[science fiction]] genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as [[literature]] or more specifically, [[poetry]], include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the [[Royal Literary Fund]].<ref>{{cite web| first=Mario | last=Petrucci | url=http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | title=Creative Writing&nbsp;– Science | accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref>

Ladd"; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see [[Truth table#Truth table for all binary logical operators|truth table]]), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Parents explain more often to boys than to girls during shared scientific thinking|journal=[[Psychol.

=== Science policy ===
{{Main article|Science policy|History of science policy|Funding of science|Economics of science}}
[[File:Clinton&1998NobelLaureates.jpg|thumb|President Clinton meets the 1998 U.S. [[Nobel Prize]] winners in the White House]]
Science policy is an area of [[public policy]] concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including [[research funding]], often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] (such as the civil engineering works in [[Hydraulic engineering#Antiquity|hydraulic engineering]] of [[Sunshu Ao]] (孙叔敖 7th c. BCE), [[Ximen Bao]] (西门豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE) ) and science for thousands of years. These works date at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications (such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which took 2000 years to complete) during the [[Warring States period]] in China. In [[Great Britain]], governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] in the 17th century recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and state funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]] and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] for the United States government, the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

[[Science, technology and society|Science and technology]] research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most [[developed country|developed countries]] is between 1.5% and 3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref name="OECD2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |format=PDF |title=Main Science and Technology Indicators&nbsp;– 2008-1 |publisher=[[OECD]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tamBWVvW?url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}</ref> In the [[OECD]], around two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for [[Basic science|basic scientific research]]. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "[[Blue skies research|blue-sky]]" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).

=== Media perspectives ===
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dickson | first=David | date=October 11, 2004 | url=http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621053624/http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archivedate=June 21, 2010 | title=Science journalism must keep a critical edge | publisher=Science and Development Network

=== Political usage ===
{{See also|Politicization of science}}

Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by [[politician]]s. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the [[United Kingdom]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] [[inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, [[Edwina Currie]], for revealing the high probability that [[Battery cage|battery]] farmed eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm|title=1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim|last=|first=|date=December 3, 1988|work=BBC News|access-date=November 4, 2016|via=}}</ref>

=== Science and the public ===
Various activities are developed to facilitate communication between the general public and science/scientists, such as [[science outreach]], [[public awareness of science]], [[science communication]], [[science festival]]s, [[citizen science]], [[science journalism]], [[public science]], and [[popular science]]. See [[:Template:Science and the public|Science and the public]] for related concepts.

Science is represented by the 'S' in [[STEM fields]].

== Philosophy of science ==
{{See also|Philosophy of science}}
Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.<ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii" /> Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.

The belief that scientific theories should and do represent [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]]. It can be contrasted with [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realism]], the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as [[electrons]]. One form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or [[consciousness]] is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.{{efn|This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."}} In an idealistic [[world view]], what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

In order to do this, he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model, and invent a way to analyze extremely large numbers.]]

There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]],{{efn|name=Galileo1638|In his investigation of the [[law of falling bodies]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one
end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We . . . now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.}} which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.<ref>"...&nbsp;[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''."&nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}</ref> Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[Bayesianism]]{{Sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}} and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].<ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003">{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003}}</ref>{{rp|236}}

Empiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.<ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" />{{rp|20}} [[Critical rationalism]] is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.<ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" />{{rp|63–67}} Popper proposed replacing verifiability with [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with [[Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method.<ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" />{{rp|68}} Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].<ref>Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation.'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117–8}}</ref> It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Objective Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

Another approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed "shut up and multiply,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|title=Shut up and multiply|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2015|website=LessWrong Wiki|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref> emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W. H. | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 30|isbn = 0-7100-0913-5}}</ref> It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Close to instrumentalism is [[constructive empiricism]], according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.

[[Paul Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]] and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend advocates treating science as an [[ideology]] alongside others such as [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified. He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]){{discuss}} that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of law and process across time and space]].<ref>{{cite book| isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref>

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like "[[creation science]]" is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.{{efn|{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&nbsp;— [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, "A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.".}} That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]]. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D. Natural Ethical Facts: Evolution, Connectionism, and Moral Cognition|author = Brugger, E. Christian|volume = 58| issue = 2|year = 2004|ref = harv}}</ref> The absence of these standards, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]], biased [[observational studies]] and other common [[fallacy|fallacies]] are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.

=== Certainty and science ===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|right|The [[DNA]] [[double helix]] is a [[molecule]] that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es.]]

A scientific theory is [[empirical]]{{efn|name=Galileo1638}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/|title=The Structure of Scientific Theories|last=Winther|first=Rasmus Grønfeldt|date=2015|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref> and is always open to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly [[Certainty|certain]] as science accepts the concept of [[fallibilism]].{{efn|"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&nbsp;—[[Albert Einstein]], noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918–1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.}} The philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty&nbsp;... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."{{sfn|Popper|1996}}{{rp|4}}

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]], it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.<ref name="Stanovich2007" />{{rp|119–38}} While there are such famous cases as the [[theory of relativity]] that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various [[research]]ers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.<ref name="Stanovich2007" />{{rp|123}} Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.{{efn|{{cite book|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|authorlink=Ludwik Fleck|editor1-first=Thaddeus J. |editor1-last=Trenn|editor2-first=Robert K |editor2-last=Merton|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-25325-2}} Claims that before a specific fact "existed", it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. [[Steven Shapin]] (1980) "A view of scientific thought" ''Science'' ccvii (Mar 7, 1980) 1065–66 states "[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. "}} For example, [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], [[evolution|the theory of evolution]], [[relativity theory]], and [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered [[fact]]ual.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=One side can be wrong | first1=Richard | last1=Dawkins | first2=Jerry | last2=Coyne | date=September 2, 2005}}</ref>
Philosopher [[Barry Stroud]] adds that, although the best definition for "[[knowledge]]" is contested, being [[skeptical]] and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically, then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the [[truth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |title=Barry Stroud on Scepticism |publisher=philosophy bites |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> The [[fallibilist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&nbsp;S. Peirce]] argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or [[hyperbolic doubt]] is fruitless<ref>Peirce (1877), "The Fixation of Belief", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 1–15, see §IV on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA6 pp. 6–7].

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]]. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is ''the'' cause of&nbsp;...", but rather "What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of&nbsp;...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. [[psychology]], [[physical cosmology]]).<ref name="Stanovich2007">{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}}</ref>{{rp|141–47}} Of course, [[research]] often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.<ref name="Stanovich2007" />{{rp|141–47}} For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.

=== Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science ===
An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].{{efn|"''Pseudoscientific&nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science," research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas.

Although encyclopedias such as Pliny's (fl. 77 AD) ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as [[Alhazen]] (''[[Critique of Ptolemy|Doubts Concerning Ptolemy]]''), [[Roger Bacon]], [[Witelo]], [[John Pecham]], Francis Bacon (1605), and [[C. S. Peirce]] (1839–1914) provided the [[Scientific community|community]] to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as "[[affirming the consequent]]."
{{quote|sign=[[Francis Bacon]]|source="[[The Advancement of Learning]]", Book 1, v, 8|"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."}} The methods of [[Method of Elenchus#Method|inquiry]] into a problem have been known for thousands of years,<ref>In mathematics, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno#Dialogue with Meno's slave|Meno]]'' demonstrates that it is possible to know logical propositions, such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and even to prove them, as cited by {{harvnb|Crease|2009|pp=35–41}}</ref> and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of [[measurement]]s, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.

[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability|intersubjective pattern recognition]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.<ref>Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}</ref>{{rp|44}} Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility."<ref name=Ziman1978>{{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}</ref>{{rp|46}} He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.<ref name=Ziman1978 />{{rp|104}}

=== Basic and applied research ===
[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Anthropogenic [[air pollution|pollution]] has an effect on the Earth's environment and [[climate]]]]

Although some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question "what is the ''use'' of basic research?" he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113522/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archivedate=January 19, 2012 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough&nbsp;— Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cells]] did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.<ref name="Stanovich2007" />{{rp|106–10}}
In a nutshell, basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].

=== Research in practice ===
Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well-funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.<ref name=simonton2013>{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602–02|doi=10.1038/493602a|year=2013|pmid=23364725|bibcode=2013Natur.493..602S}}</ref> D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.<ref name=simonton2013 />
