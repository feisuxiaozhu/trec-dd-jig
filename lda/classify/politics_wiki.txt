'''Politics''' (from Greek[[Turkish language|:]] Politiká: ''Politika'', definition "affairs of the cities") is the process of [[Decision-making|making decisions]] applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of [[governance]] — organized control over a human community, particularly a [[State (polity)|state]]. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (this is usually a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting  or forcing one's own political views among people, [[negotiation]] with other political subjects, making [[law]]s, and exercising [[force (law)|force]], including [[warfare]] against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from [[clans]] and [[tribes]] of traditional societies, through modern [[local government]]s, [[company|companies]] and institutions up to [[sovereign state]]s, to the [[international politics|international level]].

It is very often said that politics is about power.<ref name="Political Geography">{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Joe|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Alex|title=Political Geography|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculyork/reader.action?docID=10870263}}</ref> A [[political system]] is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. [[History of political thought]] can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the works of [[Confucius]].

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the same [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word from which the title of [[Aristotle]]'s book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (Πολιτικά, ''Politika'') also derives; ''politika'' means "affairs of the cities". The book title was rendered in [[Early Modern English]] in the mid-15th century as "Polettiques"<!--[sic]-->;<ref>''The Diets and Sayings of the Philosophers'' (Early English Text Society, Original Series [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7G0AAAAIAAJ&q= No. 211], 1941; reprinted 1961), p. 154: "the book of Etiques<!--[sic]--> and of Polettiques<!--[sic]-->".</ref> it became "politics" in [[Modern English]]. The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus |title=A Latin Dictionary |author= Charlton T.

== History of state politics ==

The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and [[economics]] of the institutions of [[government]].
The Master’s programme History of Politics and Society provides you with a thorough understanding of the historical roots of the most important political and societal issues that politicians, journalists and policy makers are concerned with today. You will study the historical development of democracy, civil society, citizenship, and economic inequality in an international comparative perspective. The programme focuses largely on the 19th and 20th centuries and has an interdisciplinary approach: you will combine historical research with concepts and explanations derived from the social sciences.
=== The state ===
{{Main article|State (polity)}}

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the ''[[Ancient warfare|art of warfare]]''. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21 August 1970|volume=169|issue=3947|doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733|pmid=17820299|pages=733–8|bibcode=1970Sci...169..733C}}</ref>

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the American  Revolution put an end to the "[[divine right of kings]]".  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>  to the 21st century AD British Monarchy.  Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of [[Hereditary monarchy]].

The king often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|council]] without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].<ref>{{cite|url=http://history-world.org/absolutism.htm|work=International World History Project|title=European Absolutism And Power Politics|date=1998|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html |title=Constitutional Monarchy |publisher= British Monarchist League Ltd |accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref>

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earls]] and [[dukes]] in England and Scotland, the [[dukes]] and [[counts]] in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=73–96 |quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}</ref>

== Themes ==

=== Forms of political organization ===
There are many forms of political organization, including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.

According to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. 

All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]]. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]] has a more dispersed system of [[judicial power]].<ref> http://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation </ref> In the [[American Civil War]], the contention of the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=politics+history#v=onepage&q= |pages=1–164 |year=1900 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Co. |accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref>

=== Global politics ===
{{Main article| Global politics}}
'''[[Global politics]]''' include different '''practices''' of political [[globalization]] in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international '''organizations'''. The [[United Nations]] has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabinowitch |first=Eugene |authorlink=Eugene Rabinowitch |title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QsAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=World+politics+final+nuclear+holocaust&q=World%20politics%20final%20nuclear%20holocaust |date=June 1973 |page=13 |issn=0096-3402 |quote=...the rationale of traditional patterns of world politics. |publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.}}</ref> Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is out of the question for man, "[[nuclear blackmail]]" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dulles |first=Allen |authorlink=Allen Dulles |title=The Craft of Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mH3qdHK6_EsC&pg=PA224&dq=the+craft+of+intelligence+April+1963#v=onepage&q= |page=224 |year=2006 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=1599215772 |quote=...using 'nuclear blackmail' as a threat to intimidate other countries.}}</ref> On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] from the implementation of U.S. vs [[U.S.S.R.]] nuclear blackmail policy.

According to [[political science]] professor [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], global politics is affected by ''values'': norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each:
{{quote| Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.<ref>{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= http://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | pages= x | accessdate= 2016-02-19}}</ref>}}

=== Political corruption ===
{{Main article|Political corruption}}
[[William Pitt the Elder]], speaking before the British [[House of Lords]], 9 January 1770, observed: "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."<ref>{{cite book |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |editor-first=William|editor-last=Safire |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=566}}</ref> This was echoed more famously by [[John Dalberg-Acton]] over a century later: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<ref name="lmcone">Dalberg-Acton, John (Lord Acton). [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887]. Published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)</ref>

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.<ref>{{cite web|title=Political Coruption Law & Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/political-corruption/|website=USLegal|accessdate=2016-11-26}}</ref>

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - African corruption 'on the wane'|publisher=}}</ref> A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Political parties ===
{{Main article|political party}}

A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Politics as an academic discipline ===

[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&pg=PA566&dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely |page=566 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=0-19-534334-4 |quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}</ref> Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-538-49719-0|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}</ref> Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |title=Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies |journal=Public Affairs Quarterly |date=July 2001 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=193–217 |ssrn=1755117 |accessdate=|issn=0887-0373}}</ref>

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Farr |first1=James |last2=Seidelman |first2=Raymond |title=Discipline and history |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&pg=PA70&dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&q= |year=1993 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-06512-2 |quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}</ref>

== Political values ==
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the [[Ronald Inglehart|Inglehart]]–[[Christian Welzel|Welzel]] Cultural Map of the World based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]
{{Main article|Political spectrum}}

Several different [[political spectrum|political spectra]] have been proposed.

=== Left–right ===
Political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.<ref name="Knapp">{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY3b0mcDF9QC|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140447576|language=en}}</ref>

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification]] while the left wing often values [[reform]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C |author=Daniel J. Levinson |title=CONSERVATISM AND RADICALISM |publisher=''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' |accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref>

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.<ref name="Bobbio">[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction'' (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0-226-06246-5}}</ref>

Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."<ref>Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997</ref> Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#"National Action" politics|National Action Party]] in Mexico.<ref>https://www.miis.edu/media/view/18971/original/balenouvelleresarticle.pdf</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Authoritarian–libertarian ===

[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",<ref>{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}</ref> while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as [[sovereign]]. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]], who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, theoretically, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of [[society]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EOe-99rlnJ0C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=%2522+In+their+purest+form,+libertarians+are+anarchists,+who%2522&source=bl&ots=BpMS5KfC_i&sig=Eb2w7P3zfjm9KjXThAAbaBqmcII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD47yfkv7OAhUIVyYKHRLDDOUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=%2522%2520In%2520their%2520purest%2520form%252C%2520libertarians%2520are%2520anarchists%252C%2520who%2522&f=false|title=Politics|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}</ref>

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',<ref name=Adams>Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.</ref>) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"<ref>[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp |date=24 March 2007 }}</ref>
For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."<ref name="ReferenceA">[[L. Susan Brown]].
